Hurling is an Irish team sport. More information about the sport can be found here. I started playing Hurling at the University of Connecticut in 2016 and have played Hurling for the Hartford GAA since 2020. Analytics for sports has been gaining popularity, but I noticed there is little discussion about analytics techniques for Hurling. The following project is my work to start the process of better understanding the game. The goal is provide insight on how to improve both individual and team performance. Up Hartford!
